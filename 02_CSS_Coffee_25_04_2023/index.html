                        Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole
                        with about 85% of the production; robusta accounts for
                        the remaining 30%. In Brazil, arabica production is
                        located in the main coffee-growing cluster of states led
                        by Rio where arabica is produced almost exclusively.
                        Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much
                        smaller state of Espirito Santo where about 80% of the
                        coffee is robusta.
